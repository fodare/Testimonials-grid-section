               transition and have herd some people who had and amazing
               experience here. I signed up for <br />
               the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! i enrolled
               shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br />
               weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life .Since
               completing the course, i've <br />

               "Before joining the bootcamp, I've I've <br />
               never written a line of code. I needed <br />some structure from
               professionals <br />
               who can help me learn programming <br />step bt step. I was
               encouraged to <br />
               enroll by a former studet of theirs <br />who cna only say
               womderful things <br />
               about the program. The entire <br />
               curriculum and staff did not <br />
               dissappoint. They were very hands-on <br />
               and i never had to wait long for <br />
               assitance. The agile team project, in <br />
               particular, was outstanding. It took <br />
               my learning to the next level in a way <br />
               that no tutorial could ever have. In <br />
               fact, i've often referred to it during <br />
               interviews as an example of my <br />
               developement experience. It certainly <br />
               helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
               developer after receiving multiple <br />
               offers. 100% recommendeds "
